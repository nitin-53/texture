# About me

I'm a computer science graduate. My hobbies are reading, playing badminton and ping pong. I like poetry, Indian classical music and of course Bollywood music. My main motive to start blogging is to share what I learn, read. The sharing of learning, information and views spread knowledge, awareness and also impact positively on the self-learning. I will write here on various topics and subjects.
